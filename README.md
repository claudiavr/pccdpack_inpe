## Introduction

The pccdpack_inpe repository has a set of IRAF routines to polarimetric reduction of data obtained using the IAGPOL polarimeter. It is heavily based on the original pccdpack package developed by Antonio Pereyra.

## Developers

Many routines were originally written by Antonio Pereyra with the collaboration of Antonio Mario Magalhaes.

Development at INPE were done by:
Claudia Vilega Rodrigues
Victor de Souza Magalh√£es
Karleyne M. G. de Souza
